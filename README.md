Insights:
------------------------------------------------


1. High Deductions:
Pre-Invoice deduction and Total Post invoice deductions constitutes 49.5% of sales. This suggests that a substantial portion of the revenue is subject to deductions, potentially impacting profitability.

2. Market-Capture Approach:
Post-2019, Atliq pursued aggressive market share gains, resulting in negative gross margins and net profits. This "burn rate" strategy, implemented without defined limits, led to substantial revenue losses.

3. Uniform Gross Margin %:
All product segments exhibit a uniform 36% gross margin, regardless of revenue contribution. Since top-selling products likely possess greater profit potential, the company may be foregoing higher revenues by not implementing a tiered pricing strategy.

4. Forecast Accuracy %:
Customer-level forecast accuracy % exhibit  wide variation (44-79%). Reducing this variability is crucial for improved inventory planning and management. Efforts should be to take forecast accuracy close to 90%.
